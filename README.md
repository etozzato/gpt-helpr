### What is GptHelpr?

It is sometime necessary to provide context and explanations for your code. Instead of manually copying and formatting code snippets, GPT-Helpr automates the process with an interactive cli, generating a well-structured Markdown output, which can be copied to your clipboard or printed to file.

### Features

- **Interactive Mode**: Easily specify file paths and ranges interactively.
- **Line Numbers**: Option to include line numbers in the output.
- **Completion Support**: Supports tab completion for file paths.
- **Output to File**: Option to write the generated output to a file.

   ```ruby
   gem 'gpt_helpr'

2. **Install the Gem**

   bundle install
   ```

3. **Or Install Directly via Gem Command**
   ```sh

   ```

### Usage

#### Basic Usage

Run the tool in interactive mode:
```sh
gpt_helpr -i -ln
```

#### Command-Line Arguments

```sh

```
